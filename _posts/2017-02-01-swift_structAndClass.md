“A value type is a type whose value is copied when it is assigned to a variable or constant, or when it is passed to a function.”
“In fact, all of the basic types in Swift—integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, strings, arrays and dictionaries—are value types, and are implemented as structures behind the scenes.”
