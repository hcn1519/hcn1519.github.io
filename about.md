Writing a post takes a lot of time. Nevertheless, dedicating time to writing blog posts is worthwhile, as it promotes a deeper understanding of a subject. The educational materials we encounter often express concepts in their own words, sometimes omitting critical intermediate steps that make understanding difficult. It's up to us to spot these gaps and organize the material for coherent writing. Researching and structuring the material for writing assists us in grasping the gaps within our knowledge. This discovery process is also essential because it requires digging deep into relevant resources, sometimes even those not readily available on the web. I think it's worth learning this kind of knowledge, and it's really cool to share knowledge you can't find anywhere else!

I hope that the articles written with these thoughts will be helpful to you as well. ðŸ˜Š
